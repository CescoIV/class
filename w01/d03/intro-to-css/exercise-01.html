      <p><strong><em>The Bus Songs</em></strong> is a compilation album from American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music" target="_blank">country music</a> artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toby_Keith" target="_blank">Toby Keith</a>. The album was announced July 14, 2017, and was released September 8, 2017. It is a combination of new and older songs written by Keith. The album contains twelve songs: two new, five re-recorded, and five previously released songs. The new songs on the album are "Shitty Golfer" and "Wacky Tobaccy". The songs "Runnin' Block", "Hell No", "The Critic", "Ballad of Balad", and "Weed With Willie" have been re-recorded and are referred to as "fresh takes on old favorites" by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone" target="_blank"><em>Rolling Stone</em></a> magazine.</p>

      <h2>Focus</h2>
      <p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMT_News" target="_blank">CMT News</a>, the album gets its title from the late night recording sessions Keith has had on his tour bus. The album has been said to be focused more towards the adult fans of Keith and not likely to be broadcast on mainstream radio due to the "adult humor, drinking and self-deprecation" present within the songs included in the album.</p>

      <h2>Announcement</h2>
      <p>The album was announced on July 14, 2017. Prior to the announcement of the album, on June 23, 2017, Toby released the music video of the track "Wacky Tobaccy" – a song about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)" target="_blank">cannabis</a> – on their YouTube channel. The music video for "Wacky Tobaccy" was filmed on Keith's tour bus and contained a cameo appearance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Nelson" target="_blank">Willie Nelson</a> smoking cannabis. Rolling Stone called the music video "suitably silly," containing video of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jam_session" target="_blank">jam session</a> in Toby's tour bus "surrounded by posters of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica" target="_blank">Jamaica</a> and smoky looking graphics."</p>
