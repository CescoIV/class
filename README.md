## Office Hours
- The format is informal: the instructors are "on duty" to help with homework or anything that you may have questions about in general from class. You are strongly encouraged to use these times to also work with fellow students on assignments and projects!
- **Tuesday 5-6:15pm** In-person office hours with Britney Jo
- **Thursday 7:30-9pm** Remote office hours with Chris

## Communication
  - You have been invited to the following Slack teams:
    - [GA Immersive Students](https://ga-students.slack.com)
      - [#wdi-atx-12](https://ga-students.slack.com/messages/wdi-atx-12/)
      - [#wdi-fundamentals](https://ga-students.slack.com/messages/wdi-fundamentals/)
    - [GA ATX Alumni](https://atx-alumni.slack.com) - Austin WDI Alumni (You will be invited at end of course)
  - For informal communication that doesn't need to be private, use the `#wdi-atx-12` room.
  - If you need to talk to the instructors privately, use the Slack rooms we're creating for you with both of the instructors in it. Please don't Slack or email the instructors individually as this creates information asymmetry.
  - For jokes, memes, and all manner of nonsense, use the `#wdi-atx-12-partytime` room. Keep in mind that the Code of Conduct still applies. Absolutely have fun, but don't do anything that would get in the way of making this a positive learning environment for everyone.

## Slack Tips

- <code>&grave;hello&grave;</code>: Backticks (the top-left of the keyboard on a Mac) makes text show up in a monospace font. Great for code.
- Code blocks are made with three backticks:
  <pre>
  ```
  The backticks MUST be on a line by themselves!
  ```
  </pre>
- You can specify the language directly after the backticks to have colors show up on github
  <pre>
  ```javascript
    var words = ["hello", "what", "is", "up", "dude"];
  ```
  </pre>
- These same backtick tricks also work on **GitHub** and **Slack**.
- `@here`: Sends a message to everyone currently online in a Slack room
- Please refrain from using `@channel` unless it is absolutely necessary.

## Contact Information
The best way to contact your instructors is by using the private Slack channel created with you and both Instructional Leads.
